A dual-specificity protein kinase (phosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues) that lies downstream of Raf and directly upstream of ERK in the MAPK\/ERK pathway. It phosphorylates and activates ERK.",
            "Jnk":"JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase, also SAPK): Stress-activated protein kinase. Another class of MAPKs, also typically activated by cellular stress and inflammatory cytokines. JNK signaling is involved in apoptosis, inflammation, cell proliferation, and metabolism.",

PKC isoforms regulate diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal organization.",
            "Plcg":"PLC\u03b3 (Phospholipase C gamma): An enzyme (phospholipase) that hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid PIP2 into two second messengers: inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). This activation is often triggered by receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a key role in intracellular calcium release and PKC activation.",
            "Akt":"Akt (Protein Kinase B or PKB): A serine\/threonine-specific protein kinase that is a central node in the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway. It is activated downstream of PIP3 generation and plays crucial roles in regulating cell survival, growth, proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis.",
            "PIP3":"PIP3 (Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate): A phospholipid second messenger generated from PIP2 by the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). It plays a critical role in recruiting proteins with PH domains (like Akt\/PKB) to the plasma membrane, activating downstream signaling pathways involved in cell growth, survival, and proliferation (e.g., the PI3K\/Akt pathway).",

A dual-specificity protein kinase (phosphorylates both threonine and tyrosine residues) that lies downstream of Raf and directly upstream of ERK in the MAPK\/ERK pathway. It phosphorylates and activates ERK.",
            "Jnk":"JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase, also SAPK): Stress-activated protein kinase. Another class of MAPKs, also typically activated by cellular stress and inflammatory cytokines. JNK signaling is involved in apoptosis, inflammation, cell proliferation, and metabolism.",

PKC isoforms regulate diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal organization.",
            "Plcg":"PLC\u03b3 (Phospholipase C gamma): An enzyme (phospholipase) that hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid PIP2 into two second messengers: inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). This activation is often triggered by receptor tyrosine kinases and plays a key role in intracellular calcium release and PKC activation.",
            "Akt":"Akt (Protein Kinase B or PKB): A serine\/threonine-specific protein kinase that is a central node in the PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway. It is activated downstream of PIP3 generation and plays crucial roles in regulating cell survival, growth, proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis.",
            "PIP3":"PIP3 (Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate): A phospholipid second messenger generated from PIP2 by the action of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). It plays a critical role in recruiting proteins with PH domains (like Akt\/PKB) to the plasma membrane, activating downstream signaling pathways involved in cell growth, survival, and proliferation (e.g., the PI3K\/Akt pathway).",
